# QURSA Project - UC3M
**Quantum-based Resistant Architectures and Techniques - TED2021-130369B**

- ## Overview
The [QURSA](https://qursa.webs.uvigo.es/) project advances quantum-resistant architectures, working on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure network communications and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) for strengthening core Internet protocols. QKD aims to secure communications through quantum mechanics over complex networks. Simultaneously, the project works on integrating PQC into established protocols like TLS/DTLS, employing cryptographic methods designed to withstand quantum-level threats. These strategies operate both in conjunction to enhance overall network security, each contributing to the defense against quantum computing risks.

## Consortium
The project is a concerted effort involving **UVIGO**, **CSIC** and **UC3M**.

## Objectives
The UC3M team's objectives are:
1. **Integration of post-quantum algorithms with secure communication protocols**, aiming to blend state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques into the fabric of Internet security standards.
2. **Assessment of PQC for Internet applications and services**, emphasizing performance, energy efficiency, and feasibility, especially for IoT and resource-constrained environments.
3. **Improvement and benchmarking of open-source PQ libraries**, contributing to open-source and enhancing compatibility of PQ algorithms with current communication protocols.
